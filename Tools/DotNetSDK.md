# SDK for .NET

An SDK comprises a collection of tools tailored for developers, specific to a particular platform. These tools encompass debuggers, compilers, and libraries essential for crafting code intended to operate on a given platform, operating system, or programming language. By consolidating these elements into one package, SDKs offer a comprehensive environment for software development and execution. They also furnish additional resources such as documentation, tutorials, and guides, alongside APIs and frameworks, facilitating accelerated application development.

The SDK for .NET empowers developers to construct .NET applications that leverage cost-effective, scalable, and dependable AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2. By furnishing a suite of consistent and familiar libraries, the SDK simplifies the integration of AWS services into .NET applications.

## Programmatic Access

The SDK for .NET presents a straightforward programming paradigm granting access to a comprehensive array of AWS services. Its simplicity enhances development efficiency through the provision of prebuilt components and libraries ready for integration into applications.

These components substantially reduce the time developers typically spend on coding and debugging from the ground up. Furthermore, the SDK receives daily updates, ensuring alignment with the latest service updates and releases.

See the [AWS SDK for .NET Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/welcome.html)

## Cross Platform Support

The SDK for .NET furnishes developers with separate sets of assemblies designed for various platforms, encompassing .NET Core, .NET Standard, .NET Framework, and a Portable Class Library implementation.

The Portable Class Library implementation allows for targeting multiple platforms, such as Universal Windows Platform (UWP), as well as Xamarin on iOS and Android.


## NuGet Distribution

NuGet serves as a package management system tailored for the .NET platform, enabling you to effortlessly integrate AWSSDK packages and numerous other extensions into your project. It consistently maintains previous and current versions of AWSSDK packages.

Furthermore, NuGet adeptly handles dependencies among packages, automatically installing all necessary packages as required.

To learn how to install AWSSDK packages with NuGet, see [Install AWSSDK packages with NuGet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/v3/developer-guide/net-dg-install-assemblies.html).

## Extension Libraries

The SDK for .NET extension libraries, supplied by AWS, introduce additional functionalities and capabilities beyond those found in the core SDK for .NET.

For instance, the AWS Logging .NET library extends widely-used .NET logging libraries to integrate seamlessly with Amazon CloudWatch.
